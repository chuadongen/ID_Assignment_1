# My Portfolio

This project is a 3 page portfolio excluding a contact me page. This project is my first website and will be handed up for my Interactive Development Module Assignment 1. I have 3 pages: about me, skills and experience which showcases details of me that are relevant to employers.

I have considered what the target audience (employers) might want to know about me and have included the details respectively. Such details include academic certification,technical skills and past work experience (fake).

 
## Design Process
 
This website is built for employers, to make it easy to navigate the different information I have categorised them into groups so each page showcases a different type of information.

User actions:
- As an employer, I see the technical skills of the potential employee to see if he fits the job scope
- As an employer, I read up on the background information of the employee, so I can understand if he fits our company
- As an employer, I want to know about his past work experience to see if he has relevant experience related to our company.
- As an employer I want to be able to contact him in case I have any queries or want to scout him

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
