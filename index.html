    <h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>
    <p>Greetings, I am Dong En, a 17 year old student based in Singapore. I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. My prior education consists of O level and PSLE certifications. Currently, I do not have a clear career path in mind, however I still intend to achieve a degree at a university. I am curious and like to learn about all sorts of things, I work well in teams and always complete my tasks on time. My strength is my problem solving and thinking skills, I have always loved logic questions and puzzles. As of now although I may not be technically skilled, I am willing to learn anything new. I am looking for a job that allows me to grow, both technically and as a person.
    </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Life is not all about work, I work hard and I play hard. I like playing computer games, reading, anime, kdrama and pondering about life. To keep myself fit, I exercise weekly and also enjoy sports such as basketball and badminton. I love Japan and Korea as well as my country, Singapore. I prefer a casual office/work style however I will still uphold the quality of my work. I look forward to working together with brilliant people and making a change, both in the community and in our wallets.</p>
